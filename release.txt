This document describes the process of making a new release of xrayutilities.
It is therefore not relevant for users, but only for developers and (maybe to
some extent also for) packagers.

Note: This procedure is intended for use on a Unix operating system.

CHECK EVERYTHING
================

Is everything running fine? perform the tests and run the examples

  # change the version in lib/xrayutilties/VERSION
  # update copyright notice in doc/source/conf.py and README.md
  pycodestyle lib
  # allowed output is:
lib/xrayutilities/materials/elements.py:36:1: E741 ambiguous variable name 'O'
lib/xrayutilities/materials/elements.py:140:1: E741 ambiguous variable name 'I'
lib/xrayutilities/materials/spacegrouplattice.py:991:31: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'
lib/xrayutilities/math/fit.py:93:80: E501 line too long (100 > 79 characters)
lib/xrayutilities/math/fit.py:192:80: E501 line too long (90 > 79 characters)
lib/xrayutilities/math/fit.py:266:80: E501 line too long (90 > 79 characters)
lib/xrayutilities/math/fit.py:307:80: E501 line too long (90 > 79 characters)
  # run the unit tests
  tox

UPDATE DOCUMENTATION
====================

to build the documentation from scratch first one needs to rebuild the API
documentation sources (which is done from the installed module, so make sure
you have the latest version installed!)

  sphinx-apidoc -f -o doc/source lib/xrayutilities

In the root directory of the package execute the following to rebuild the
documentation pdf. You will need sphinx, numpydoc and rst2pdf.

  python setup.py build build_doc -b pdf
  cp build/sphinx/pdf/xrayutilities.pdf .

Or generate a texinfo file using

    python setup.py build_doc -b texinfo
    cd build/sphinx/texinfo; make

UPDATE WEBPAGE
==============

rebuild the html documents and upload them to the sourceforge webserver
to have the correct style the style file needs to patched

  python setup.py build_doc -b html
  patch -p0 < doc/webpage.patch
  # in case its needed, update the patch with
  # diff -Naur build/sphinx/html/index.html.orig build/sphinx/html/index.html > doc/webpage.patch

to upload new web-documentation connect to the sourceforge server via:

  sftp://USERNAME@web.sourceforge.net/home/project-web/xrayutilities/htdocs

files on sourceforge can be moved/archived using

sftp://USERNAME@frs.sourceforge.net/home/frs/project/x/xr/xrayutilities

however, upon such a move the download statistics are lost.

PACKAGING
=========

GIT tagging
-----------

tag the version in the GIT repository and publish the version tag to Github

  git tag -a vX -m "version X"
  git push origin vX

Tarball and wheel generation
----------------------------

create a tarball for redistribution of xrayutilities without the use of git

  python setup.py sdist

creates a tarball in the directory dist, which contains everything needed for
the installation of xrayutilities

Wheels for multiple platforms are generated in the Azure cibuildwheel pipeline
(https://dev.azure.com/dominikkriegner/xrayutilities/_build). These files
should be downloaded and deployed to PyPI. The whl-files can be downloaded
after the successful run of the pipeline by the following commands:

"""
az devops login
az devops configure -d organization=https://dev.azure.com/dominikkriegner/
az devops configure -d project=xrayutilities

# determine latest runId (make sure its a successful cibuildwheel one!)
az pipelines runs list --pipeline-ids 2 --output table --top 3
runid=$(az pipelines runs list  --pipeline-ids 2 --output tsv --top 1 | cut -f 11)

# get artifact download URL
url=$(az pipelines runs artifact list --run-id $runid --output json |  python -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)[0]['resource']['downloadUrl'])")

wget -O drop.zip "$url"
unzip -j -d dist drop.zip
"""

UPDATE PyPI PACKAGE
-------------------

Upload new version to the Python package index after inspecting the dist
folder by

  twine upload dist/*

Github release and mailing list anouncement
===========================================

Finally announce the new release on Github (which will also upload the new
version to Sourceforge) and drop a mail to the user mailinglist:
xrayutilities-users@lists.sourceforge.net
